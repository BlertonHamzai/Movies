# Movies
Laravel project with user and admin roles, featuring role-based authentication and dashboards.

Project Description
The system ensures secure and efficient management of user privileges and access to application functionalities based on roles.

Key Features:
Secure Authentication and Authorization:
Strong security mechanisms are implemented to ensure only authorized users can access their designated areas.

Separate Roles and Dashboards:
Regular users (Users) and administrators (Admins) have distinct interfaces and functionalities according to their roles.

Granular Access Control:
Access is restricted based on roles using policies and middleware to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive parts of the app.

Admin Data Management:
Admins have full control over managing critical data, while users have limited access tailored to their needs.

Clean and Scalable Code Structure:
The codebase is modular and well-organized, making maintenance and future feature additions easier.

Database Export Included:
The project includes a movie.sql file to facilitate easy database import and local testing.
