## Project Description

This Laravel project implements secure and efficient management of user privileges and access to application functionalities based on roles.

---

## Key Features

- **Secure Authentication and Authorization:**  
  Strong security mechanisms ensure only authorized users can access their designated areas.

- **Separate Roles and Dashboards:**  
  Regular users (Users) and administrators (Admins) have distinct interfaces and functionalities tailored to their roles.

- **Granular Access Control:**  
  Access is restricted based on roles using policies and middleware to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive parts of the app.

- **Admin Data Management:**  
  Admins have full control over managing critical data, while users have limited access based on their needs.

- **Clean and Scalable Code Structure:**  
  The codebase is modular and well-organized, easing maintenance and future feature additions.

- **Database Export Included:**  
  The project includes a `movie.sql` file for easy database import and local testing.
